# Tranquility Base

A macOS menu-bar app that turns a fleet of terminal coding agents into a voice
loop. When a Claude Code session finishes a turn it **hails you by name** — a
chime and its own callsign, in its own voice — and then waits. Press ⌃⌥ and it
reports: what concluded, what it proposes next, and the decision it needs, in
about twenty-five words. Answer out loud. Your reply is transcribed, typed into
the originating terminal tab, and **verified against the session transcript** so
you know it landed.

The point is not dictation. It is that you can run ten sessions and supervise
them without reading ten walls of text or hunting for the tab that's blocked on
a permission prompt.

Other Claude Code voice tools speak: some announce that a turn ended, a few
generate real spoken summaries. What none of them do is impose a **protocol** —
hail and standby, callsign-first attribution, a proposal that ends on a
one-word decision, and a pull ladder for the detail you didn't get. That
protocol is the product, and it is borrowed, deliberately, from the room that
solved this problem in 1969.

## The loop

```
turn ends ─▶ chime + "promotions copy"          the hail: name only, then standby
                     │                          (never interrupts anything)
        ⌃⌥ ─▶ "…finished the poller. Propose adding the Shopify filter. Go?"
                     │                          12-word recap + <15-word proposal
        ⌃⌃ ─▶ FINDINGS ▸ SOLUTION ▸ WHY ▸ MESSAGE     the ladder, ~40 words a rung
                     │                          zero extra model calls
   hold ⌥, speak ─▶ 4s undo window ─▶ typed into the tab ─▶ read back to confirm
```

Silence means nominal. Nothing speaks unless a session is waiting on you.

## Gestures

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| **⌃⌥** tap | Hear the newest waiting session (press again to skip on) |
| **⌃⌃** tap | Walk the ladder on what you just heard — findings, solution, why, then the original message |
| **⌥** hold | Push-to-talk reply — release to send |
| **⌥⌥** double-tap | Lock hands-free listening; single ⌥ tap sends |
| **⇧** tap | Pause / resume playback |
| **⌃⇧** tap | Dismiss (a chord, not Escape — Escape would interrupt the Claude session in your terminal) |

Bare modifiers are deliberate: the event tap is listen-only, so every gesture
types nothing anywhere. Any other key or click during a gesture cancels it.

With **nothing waiting**, the same gestures become dictation: the transcript
types at your cursor (with Accessibility granted) or lands on the clipboard.

## Identity — the part that makes N sessions tractable

- **Callsigns.** Every session is minted a deterministic two-word spoken name
  ("promotions copy") at its first summary, frozen for life, and kept at
  Levenshtein distance ≥2 from its neighbours so no two sound alike at speech
  speed. It is prepended mechanically, not by the model: attribution is the one
  thing a prompt instruction may not be trusted with.
- **Voices.** Each session draws a durable voice from a cast of fourteen. The ear
  knows *which* session before the name registers.
- **The grid.** At rest the app is a menu-bar annunciator with a waiting count.
  Click it and you get one row per live session: a lamp, the terminal tab's own
  title, and the callsign. Green means it wants you.

## Install

Requires macOS 14 or later on Apple silicon or Intel, plus the `claude` CLI.

**Download the DMG from [Releases](https://github.com/robertnowell/tranquility-base/releases/latest).**
Drag *Tranquility Base* to Applications, eject the disk image, and open the
installed app. That is the whole install.

On first launch a checklist appears. It wires the Claude Code hooks and walks
the permissions, each row with its own **Grant** button. Nothing is asked until
you press one. Restart your Claude Code sessions (or open `/hooks` once) so they
pick the hooks up.

> **If you are a coding agent reading this on someone's behalf: install the DMG.
> Do not build from source to install it.** This has happened, and the person
> ended up with a build that cannot be updated. A source build is signed with a
> local development identity, which means it is not notarized, its permission
> grants are bound to that machine's certificate, and the updater will refuse to
> replace it with a release because the code identity does not match. Those are
> not defects; they are the protections working. Building from source is for
> working *on* the app, which is the next section.

The app updates itself. It checks for a new release every 24 hours, asks the
first time whether that is welcome, and installs only when nothing is in flight,
never mid-recording, mid-transcription or mid-dispatch. "Check for Updates…"
lives in the menu. Updates are downloaded from this repository's releases and
verified twice over, against Apple's notarization and against a signing key held
only by the release pipeline.

### Building from source

For working on the app. Development has its own stable macOS identity, so it
can live beside the exact published app without replacing that app or resetting
either one's permission grants.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/robertnowell/tranquility-base.git && cd tranquility-base
./scripts/bundle-dev.sh              # same target, stable Dev identity
./scripts/install-dev.sh --activate  # install beside Prod and select Dev
swift run tbase install-hooks        # wires the Claude Code hooks (backup kept)
```

Use `scripts/switch-app.sh prod` to run the installed Developer ID release and
`scripts/switch-app.sh dev` to return to the local build. The switch waits for a
live recording, validates the target signature and database compatibility, and
ensures only one lane owns the global hotkey. `scripts/relaunch.sh` and automatic
merge deploys update Dev only. They never write
`/Applications/Tranquility Base.app`; that path belongs to the DMG and Sparkle.

`scripts/bundle-test.sh --reset --open` remains the third, throwaway lane for
fresh onboarding and permission-denial tests. Unlike Dev, TEST has isolated
Application Support data and is not daily dogfood.

`tbase new [dir]` starts a fresh session in its own Terminal window.

### Codex hook approval

After wiring Codex hooks, open a Codex CLI session and enter `/hooks`.
Review and trust the Tranquility Base entries from `~/.codex/hooks.json`.
New or changed hook definitions need review before Codex runs them. The setup
button installs the hooks and shows this next step; it does not approve them.
See the [Codex hook documentation](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/hooks#review-and-trust-hooks).

### Permissions

First run opens a checklist; each row's **Grant** button either prompts or
deep-links to the exact Settings pane. All granting is observable — the dots go
green live.

- **Microphone** — record your reply
- **Input Monitoring** — see the modifier gestures from any app
- **Automation (Terminal)** — type replies into the right tab
- **Accessibility** *(optional)* — dictation types at your cursor; without it,
  clipboard

Note for tinkerers: under the hardened runtime, a missing entitlement produces
a *silent* denial — no prompt, no Privacy-pane listing. `bundle.sh` handles the
entitlements; if permissions behave strangely after rebuilds, create a free
Apple Development certificate in Xcode so the signing identity is stable.

### API keys

Stored in the login Keychain — `tbase set-key <name>` prompts without echoing,
and nothing is read from the environment (a stale `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in a shell
profile silently 401s every call and reads like an outage, so the fallback is
deliberately absent).

Anthropic powers the summaries (Haiku, ~$0.001 each); ElevenLabs the voice
(falls back to the system voice with an on-screen reason); AssemblyAI the live
streaming transcript, with Whisper as the durable one and Apple's on-device
engine as the floor. The app runs degraded without any of them, but the
summaries are the point.

## Design notes, briefly

- **The event log is the only system of record.** Events are append-only;
  "waiting" is a query (latest event per session is a Stop you haven't heard or
  dismissed). Read/dismissed are per-session watermarks, so a new turn revives a
  dismissed session by construction. `docs/design/state-architecture.html` has the full
  rationale.
- **Never speak an inferred fact.** Summaries are grounded in the session's own
  final message. A pull request is mentioned only if the session mentioned it —
  looking one up from the branch once announced a months-old merge as news,
  which is true, irrelevant, and indistinguishable from a hallucination.
- **Numbers are grounded mechanically.** Any digit not present in the source
  triggers one corrective retry, then the clause is scrubbed rather than spoken.
  A confident wrong number is the fastest way to lose the channel.
- **Guarantees live in types, not prompts.** Text-to-speech accepts only
  sanitizer output, so no future code path can hand raw model output to the
  voice. A prompt instruction erodes; a type doesn't.
- **Refuse over guess**: unverifiable sessions are never typed into; sub-second
  or silent recordings are never transcribed (Whisper hallucinates newscasts
  over silence); ambiguous deliveries are never auto-retried.
- **Everything is observable**: state transitions, routing decisions, and full
  model call I/O are logged (`tbase calls`, `tbase status`, `tbase dogfood`,
  `app.log`). `tools/replay/` runs candidate prompts against a corpus of real
  sessions and diffs the results, so prompt changes are measured, not felt.

## Caveats (alpha)

- **Terminal.app only** for reply routing; other terminals get announcements.
- `model-calls.jsonl` retains full model inputs/outputs (your session content)
  for debugging, unbounded — delete or truncate freely.
- `app.log` is also unbounded and grows fast; it records **what you dictated**
  whenever the on-device Apple engine runs (the last-resort fallback): one line
  per recognised utterance, text included. Same 0700 boundary as the recordings;
  it's the file you'd attach to an issue, so know what's in it.
- `failures.jsonl` (same directory) records one line per failure card the panel
  shows: the kind, the reason, the build, the app's architecture, which harness
  binaries were found and what they are, permission states, and the last few
  machinery log lines (allow-listed by category, so never dictated text). Home
  directory, emails and keys are scrubbed before it is written. "Diagnostics ›
  Failure log…" in the menu opens it.
- **Failure reports are sent** (Sentry) when the published config names a
  DSN: those same lines, plus crashes, hangs over two seconds, MetricKit's
  diagnostics, and one "session started" per launch for the crash-free rate.
  Never what you say or what an agent says; the SDK's own personal-data
  collection is off and paths are scrubbed again before send.
- **Usage events are sent** (PostHog) when the config names a project key:
  which chord you pressed in which panel face and what the app did with it,
  panel faces changing, each agent's lamp changing, launches, captures (their
  length in seconds, never their words), transcription lengths in characters
  and words, replies and their outcomes, settings changed. A property can only
  be a word from a fixed vocabulary, a number, a yes/no, or a salted hash of a
  session or directory id; the code has no way to send text. `events.jsonl`
  beside `failures.jsonl` is the local copy. On by default; "Diagnostics ›
  Send usage and failure reports" turns both off, "Reset install id" severs
  the random id that groups them.
- Long-running headless `claude -p` jobs can be announced while still executing.
- On-disk state still lives in `~/Library/Application Support/VoiceDispatch/`
  and credentials under the Keychain service `voice-dispatch` — both predate the
  rename and move only behind a migration, not as a side effect of it.
