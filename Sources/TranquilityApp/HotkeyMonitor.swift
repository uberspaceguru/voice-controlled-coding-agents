/// it are load-bearing and were kept deliberately:
///
/// 1. **A `CGEvent` tap, not `NSEvent.addGlobalMonitorForEvents`.** The AppKit
///    monitor is unreliable for modifier-only chords while the app is in the
///    background, and a macOS 26 field report has it crashing outright.
/// 2. **Do not restart a tap that is already running.** Permission polling calls
///    `start()` every couple of seconds; restarting resets the pressed state and
///    would kill an in-progress recording mid-utterance.
///
/// Listen-only means this needs Input Monitoring rather than Accessibility — it
/// observes the chord without consuming it. That is also why the shortcut is a
/// modifier combination rather than a bare key: an unconsumed bare key would still
/// reach whatever app is focused. Wispr Flow refuses bare keys for the same reason.
