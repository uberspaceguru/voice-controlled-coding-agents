/// Hands-free over WebRTC: the media path Pipecat prescribes for a device

///
/// The difference from `ManagerSocket` is not the wire, it is what the wire
/// brings. WebRTC carries echo cancellation, so the microphone reaching the
/// transcriber no longer contains the manager's own voice, so the bot no longer
/// has to feed its transcriber silence while it speaks, so a word said over the
/// manager is heard. Measured 22 Sep on the real acoustic path, laptop speakers
/// to built-in microphone: the bot spoke for eight seconds without hearing
/// itself, and "Stop" over it was transcribed, judged and acted on inside a
/// second. Noise suppression, gain control, a jitter buffer and reconnection
/// come with it.
///
/// Two things this class has to get right, both learned by measurement rather
/// than documentation:
///   - The audio device module must be `platformDefault`, the one that speaks
///     to the HAL. A factory built with no arguments enumerates no devices at
///     all, and then takes whatever the system default is, which is the AirPods
///     and the failure `AudioInputDevice.swift` exists to prevent.
///   - A running module will not change microphones underneath itself:
///     `trySetInputDevice` returns true and does nothing. Stop, set, start.
