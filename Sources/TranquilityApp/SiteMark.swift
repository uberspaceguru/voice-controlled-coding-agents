/// The site mark: a lamp resting on a hairline.
///
/// Ruled 18 Aug from the identity research (docs/ — the brief lives in HQ under
/// 2026-08-18-tranquility-base-mark-system). It is drawn from the instrument
/// rather than applied to it: the circle is the 9px lamp that is this app's
/// entire status vocabulary, and the bar is the hairline that rules every strip
/// and footer. Nothing here is a new shape.
///
/// It answers to three readings at once, which is why it was chosen over a
/// fused TB lettermark and over a bare ring:
///
///   - a landing site — a body resting on a surface, which is the name;
///   - a figure — head above shoulders, the pictogram grammar of a person
///     standing attentively, so the mark reads as an agent waiting on you;
///   - the lamp itself — the same circle the panel lights, so the mark and the
///     status vocabulary are the same object at two sizes.
///
/// **Filled means the same thing here as everywhere else on the panel.** Solid
/// is unread/working — something wants you; hollow is heard, nothing new. That
/// rule is `GridRowView`'s and `CollapsedStrip`'s already, and the menu bar now
/// speaks it too rather than swapping to an unrelated symbol.
///
/// ## Why filled paths and not strokes
///
/// The ring is an ANNULUS — an outer oval with an inner oval punched out under
/// the even-odd rule — not a stroked circle. Apple's custom-symbol guidance is
/// explicit (WWDC21): "make sure to convert any strokes to paths", "avoid using
/// open paths", flat fills only. A stroked path also scales its own line width
/// with the transform in ways that are easy to get wrong at 16px; a filled
/// annulus is the same shape at every size by construction.
