/// What a page is allowed to ask this app to do, and on what terms.
///
/// A deep link is the one control surface this app exposes to the open web:
/// ANY page in a browser can fire one, and the only thing standing in front of
/// it is the browser's own "open Tranquility Base?" sheet. So the rules are
/// stricter here than anywhere else in the app, and they are HERE — in Core,
/// as pure functions over strings — rather than inside the AppKit handler,
/// because the handler needs a window server and cannot be tested, while this
/// is the part that has to be right.
///
/// Two standing rules, and everything below enforces one of them:
///
/// 1. **No deep link may record, send, or type.** Speaking and raising a panel
///    are safe: you can hear what happened and you can see who asked. Opening a
///    microphone from a URL is a page deciding you had something to say, and the
///    browser's consent sheet is consent to open an app, not consent to be
///    recorded. `discuss` does exactly what a tap on that agent's grid row
///    does (ruled 9 Sep): a green row is read aloud, a live row opens its
///    terminal, a dead row is revived. None of those record, send, or type.
///    `reply` ARMS: it puts the target in front of you and waits for a
///    gesture you make yourself (ruled 11 Aug). Neither ever opens the
///    microphone.
/// 2. **A page's strings never reach a shell.** The invitation builds a command
///    out of the subject the page names, which arrives from the URL. It is
///    interpolated through AppleScript INTO a shell, so two quoting layers have
///    to hold at once. `subject(from:exists:)` refuses anything that could make
///    either of them slip.
///
/// A subject is one of exactly two things, and the difference is where the page
/// came from. A LOCAL page names a file, and that file must already exist on
/// this disk — which alone kills the injection class, since an attacker's
/// string has to name something you already have. A HOSTED page cannot name a
/// local file (it lives on someone else's machine, and its own footer has been
/// stripped of any path by the publisher), so it names its own https URL. That
/// cannot be checked for existence, so it is constrained by shape instead:
/// https only, no credentials, no forbidden characters, and a length cap.

    /// The page's button is the grid row's tap, reached from a different

    /// had finished and exited opened a card with no way back to the agent:
