/// The four bands that decide which agents exist and what state each is in.
///
/// Moved out of `AppDelegate+Grid.swift` on 13 Sep (#381), before a fifth band
/// was added to it. The reason is a measurement rather than a preference:
/// `Sources/TranquilityApp` is 26,801 lines, 43% of the source, and
/// `Package.swift` declares exactly one test target, depending on
/// `TranquilityCore`. **The app layer has no unit tests and no target that
/// could hold one.** Adding a band to an untestable function in the
/// fastest-growing, least-tested half of the codebase makes the worst measured
/// trend worse.
///
/// Row assembly is not interface code. It decides which agents exist and what
/// state each is in, which is domain logic that happened to be written in the
/// view layer because that is where it was first needed. `Coordinator`'s own
/// header states the standard it belongs to: "Deliberately UI-free so it can be
/// driven from `tbase` and from tests exactly as the app drives it, the
/// integration path and the tested path are the same code."
///
/// **Parameters, not ownership** (ruled 13 Sep). Every one of the nine ways the
/// old function reached the world is an input here, and the app keeps the two
/// caches it owns (`lastSeenLive`, `delivering`) and hands them in. The
/// alternative, a stateful Core type owning the liveness-grace cache, is the
/// redesign `GridAssembler`'s own comment declined in August; it is a better
/// long-run shape and it would put a rewrite of liveness smoothing on the
/// critical path to a checkpoint, which is the wrong trade for a two-day task.
///
/// **No band logic changed in the move.** The bodies below are the previous
/// ones, comments included, with their inputs renamed from ambient reads to
/// parameters.
