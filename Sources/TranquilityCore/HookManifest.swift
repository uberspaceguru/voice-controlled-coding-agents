///      exit 0 whatever happens, which is right for a hook and means a MISSING script
///      is indistinguishable from a healthy one. The rename from voice-dispatch-hook
///      to tbase-hook left settings.json pointing at a file that no longer existed;
///      events stopped for 37 minutes during active use and the only symptom was
///      session lamps that would not turn green.
///   2. A hook added to the repo after someone last ran install-hooks is simply never
///      installed, and nothing mentions it. `artifact-hook` shipped and was absent on
///      this machine when the manifest was written.
///   3. Paths are absolute and derived from the working directory at install time, so
///      moving the repo silently breaks every one of them.
///
/// This type is the comparison those three needed. It does not install anything —
/// noticing and repairing are separate acts, and the first is what was missing.
