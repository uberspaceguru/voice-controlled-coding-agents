///
/// It exists because the five keyboard drills the 10 Sep incident asked for
/// could not be run by synthetic system input: `HotkeyMonitor`'s tap is
/// system-wide, so a drill's keystrokes interleave with the user's real ones —
/// on 11 Sep a synthetic drill ended a live hands-free dictation and auto-sent
/// it. The gesture DECISION is unit-tested in `InstantArmTests` (interference
/// after commit → `endReply`, never abort). This drill is the other half: that
/// `LiveAudioCapture.abandon` KEEPS a committed capture and that
/// `QueueStore.reconcileOnBoot` SURFACES a kept file as a Recents row.
///
/// One implementation, two callers: the app runs it under `--selftest-hud` on
/// every deploy and reports each group through `SelfTest`; `tbase keepdrill`
/// runs it on demand. Returning results rather than logging keeps Core free of
