///
/// The manager (tb-voice) listens all day, decides with Jev whether it was
/// addressed, and drives the fleet through the doors the app already has:
/// `tbase send`, `tbase new`, and the speak-only deep links. What the app owes
/// it is a place to stand: the app spawns it exactly the way it spawns an ACP
/// agent, reads one JSON line per event from its stdout, and paints the orb
/// and the state label from those lines. The child never learns anything
/// about the app's audio path, and the app never parses the child's speech.
///
/// `ManagerEvent` is the contract. A native manager written in Core later
/// emits the same lines, and the orb does not know the difference.
