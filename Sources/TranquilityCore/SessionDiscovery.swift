    /// to ask, so every row reads `.unknown` uniformly rather than risk a
    /// wrong guess in either direction. `revivable` follows from that: true
    /// whenever the launch directory still exists, NOT gated on
    /// `liveness == .gone` the way Claude Code's is. Attempting a resume is
    /// always safe to try — `SessionLauncher.attemptCodexResume` reads
    /// Codex's own answer, live or not, rather than needing to know in
    /// advance. There is no `join(_:live:)` counterpart for this function:
    /// unlike Claude Code, there is nothing to join a process-table result
    /// onto — `.unknown` is deliberately the whole, final answer for every
    /// row, not a first half waiting for a second.
    ///
    /// The uncached full walk — `discoverCodexIfScanned` below is what the
    /// grid actually calls. Caching landed the same day this function did
    /// support a wired call site (22 Aug): CLAUDE.md rule 9 is explicit that
    /// an archive walk must never run inline on the main actor, and this one
    /// measured close to a second against 19 real rollouts on this machine
    /// — a number that only grows, the same shape `ScanCache` already exists
    /// to solve for Claude Code's own hundreds of transcripts.
