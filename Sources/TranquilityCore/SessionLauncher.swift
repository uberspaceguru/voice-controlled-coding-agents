    /// prefers /opt/homebrew/bin/tmux, the Apple Silicon path, and only falls
    /// back to /usr/local because on this machine the first does not exist.

    /// - Registration and the first transcript append happen BEFORE the
    ///   resume-choice prompt is answered, so a revived session reads LIVE in
    ///   `claude agents --json` while it is actually blocked on that
    ///   question. The trust prompt is the opposite: nothing registers until
    ///   it is answered. Liveness is not evidence the pane needs no attention.
    /// - A second Return on the resume prompt would pick "summary
    ///   (recommended)", the cheap option — wrong owner, not catastrophe.
    ///   The early return in `TrustPromptWatcher.watch` is what keeps that
    ///   press from happening.

    /// The needle wording itself has rotted before and will again: "Do you
    /// trust" was the pre-2.1 Claude Code prompt; v2.1.x renders "Quick
    /// safety check: … ❯ 1. Yes, I trust this folder" — matched on "trust
    /// this folder", with the old needle kept for older CLIs. The
    /// started-sentinel was `? for shortcuts` (also gone); it is now the
    /// banner word "Claude" — capital C, so the lowercase `claude` in the
    /// echoed launch command cannot satisfy it. Two consecutive sightings,
    /// because a single read can catch the pane mid-boot.
    ///
    /// Verified live 19 Aug against a real tmux pane: the v2.1 "trust this
    /// folder" screen read cleanly through capture-pane and a single
    /// send-keys Enter accepted it, with registration correctly absent
    /// until it did. Before 23 Aug this loop had a second implementation
    /// (the old watcher's own AppleScript read/press over a
    /// Terminal.app tab, one hand-copied 40-line pair for the transport
    /// that no longer exists) — deleted, not merely superseded, once the
    /// Terminal-tab overload stopped being reachable through anything
    /// but this one.
    /// `onNeedsHuman` is the panel's half of the same event, added 27 Aug.
    /// Opening the window is necessary and was never sufficient: a launch you
    /// walked away from puts a window somewhere behind whatever you are
    /// actually looking at, and the panel — the one surface this app promises
    /// you can watch instead of a terminal — went on showing a spinner. The
    /// window is the place to ANSWER; the card is the place to find out there
    /// is something to answer. Optional, so `tbase` and the tests keep the
    /// window-only behaviour they had.
