    /// `GridAssembler` treats it as one: a session the file says is working
    /// goes grey when its status claims idle, on the rule that a process
    /// which says it is idle outranks a file that looks busy. Sound for a
    /// harness that genuinely reports, and a lie for one that never did.
    ///
    /// That cost the same bug twice. On 30 Aug a Codex session sat grey while
    /// its pane read "Working (24s)", and the fix was to INJECT a status from
    /// the hook boundary — which papered over the default rather than
    /// removing it. On 01 Sep the injection was retired (the classifier can
    /// read a rollout now and no longer needs a proxy), the `?? "idle"`
    /// underneath was still there, and Robert sent the same screenshot of the
    /// same pane reading "Working (24s)".

    /// So: no invented status. Codex has no `agents --json`
    /// (`registersWithLiveness == false`) and therefore no process-level
    /// answer at all; nil says exactly that, and the file — which does know —
    /// decides. Callers may still inject one when they have a real source.

    /// Name is the same shape of problem. `discoverCodex` learned to read
