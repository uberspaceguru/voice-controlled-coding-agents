/// Ending a session for good — the mechanism behind the grid's Terminate.
///
/// The old shape (13 Aug) sent one `SIGTERM` and logged that it had sent it.
/// That is a receipt for a signal, not for a death, and the difference is the
/// whole feature: "end session" has to mean the process is gone, or the row you
/// just right-clicked is lying to you.
///
/// Three things measured on this machine 15 Aug, which is why this file has the
/// shape it does:
///
/// 1. `SIGTERM` is enough in the ordinary case — a probe session died inside a
///    second. The ladder starts there and stays there almost always; `SIGKILL`
///    exists for the case measurement cannot rule out, not for the common one.
///    Starting at TERM is also what keeps the session RESUMABLE: it exits clean,
///    the transcript is already appended per message, and the row comes back as
///    REVIVE having lost at most the turn in flight.
///
/// 2. `claude` leads its own process group (pid == pgid) and its MCP servers are
///    children inside it. In a Terminal.app tab the shell sits in a DIFFERENT
///    group and is the tty's session leader, so signalling the GROUP takes the
///    agent and everything it spawned, structurally incapable of reaching the
///    shell — "end the session without closing the tab" was free there, not
///    delicate, and never addressed the tab at all. Every launch is a tmux
///    pane now (ruled 21 Aug), where the pane's shell execs `claude` as its
///    last command (`/bin/zsh -c "cd … && claude …"`): ending the agent's
///    group there ends the pane's own controlling process, closing the pane
///    and the tmux session with it — not delicate either (there is no stray
///    empty pane to leave behind, and the tmux SERVER, `exit-empty off`,
///    outlives it), just a different mechanism than the paragraph above
///    describes. Reasoned from the exec chain, not independently re-measured.
///
/// 3. The liveness cache is six seconds deep, so a pid handed to us can already
///    be dead — and on a busy machine, reused. Every rung therefore re-reads the
///    process's identity immediately before it signals, and refuses if the pid is
///    no longer a Claude session. Without that guard "reliably exit the process"
///    occasionally means reliably exiting somebody else's.
///
/// The signalling is injected (`ProcessControlling`) so the ladder's decisions —
/// including the two that are invisible in production, a pid reused mid-ladder
/// and a process that survives both rungs — are asserted by `swift test` against
/// a fake rather than by killing something and hoping.
///
/// Every path here blocks while polling. Call it off-main (rule 9).
