/// live Claude Code session, one launched with the pane already in copy-mode
/// (2026-08-19-tb-delivery-protocol-proof). The shape of the guarantee: no
/// timer ever decides an outcome — every wait polls an observable
/// postcondition, every retry is guarded by dedupe against the transcript, so
/// a message can be retried forever without ever landing twice.
/// One dispatch at a time per pane, across PROCESSES.
///
/// A composer is a single shared mutable thing, and two sends into it
/// interleave exactly as badly as that sounds: the second reads the floor
/// while the first is mid-paste, joins onto a half-written message, or clears
/// it. Measured 26 Aug by the live drill — two `tbase send` calls with no gap,
/// and one of the two messages was never delivered at all.
///
/// A file lock rather than an in-process one, because the second writer is
/// usually a different process. `tbase` is a real dispatch door, not a lesser
/// one (CLAUDE.md rule 7), and crons and a second panel are the same shape; an
/// actor would serialise the app against itself and miss every case that
/// actually happens. `DeliveryInFlight` does not cover this and never meant
