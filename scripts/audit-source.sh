# Captured, never piped. `... | grep -q ...` under `set -o pipefail` reports a
# FAILED pipeline on success: grep exits the moment it matches, the writer takes
# SIGPIPE, and pipefail faithfully reports that non-zero. It cost one false
# "tests failed" on a green tree — a check that cries wolf gets deleted, so it
# is worth the extra variable.
#
# That was fixed HALF WAY the first time: the run was captured into a variable,
# and then the variable was piped into `grep -q` anyway, which is the same race
# one line further down. It reappeared on 09 Aug the moment the suite grew — the
# first "with 0 failures" sits near the top of 68KB of output, so grep matched
# and exited while printf still had most of it to write, and preflight reported
# "tests failed (exit 0)" on a tree where all 277 passed. Under `bash -x` it
# passed, which is the signature of a race and cost a while to see.
#
# So: no pipe at all. Bash can test a substring without spawning anything, and
# a check with no subprocess has no pipeline to fail.
#
# Two invocations, not one — found 24 Aug on a new machine (App-lane P9): a
# bare `swift test` here silently runs ONLY the Swift Testing suites and
# skips every XCTestCase-based test with no error, no non-zero exit, nothing
# — 31 tests reported as green while 881 XCTestCase tests never ran. Passing
# `--enable-xctest --disable-swift-testing` is what actually forces the
# XCTest bundle to run; the default/both-enabled invocation reliably drops
# it on this toolchain. `arch -arm64e` because plain `swift`/`swift test`
# resolve to the x86_64 slice in this shell, which cannot dlopen the
# arm64e-only XCTest bundle at all. Both frameworks are checked separately
# so a silent zero in either one is a hard failure, not a quiet pass.
#
# The exit STATUS is the verdict; the summary line is a corroborating check that
# the run actually happened rather than dying before it reached the tests.
# Through scripts/test.sh, which runs both invocations AND refuses to report
# success unless each half cleared a floor. The two-invocation mechanism
# was this file's, found at App-lane P9; the floor is what stops an
# "Executed 0 tests, with 0 failures" from reading as green.
# test.sh streams per-test progress and preserves complete logs and timeout
# diagnostics. Command substitution here used to hide everything until exit,
# so the hour-long stall had no last-test breadcrumb in the hosted log.

# --- the drills that were never actually wired to anything --------------------

# on every landing, but this file only ever ran the first. The other two were
# real, working, human-run-when-remembered scripts with no gate behind them:
# a regression in either could ship and nothing here would catch it before
# someone noticed by hand. Worse for Codex specifically — test-codex-
# lifecycle.sh is the ONLY thing in this repo that exercises a real Codex
# session end to end, and it wasn't run by this script even once.
#
# test-dispatch-tmux.sh is a hard gate: it drives its own tmux server on a
# dedicated socket (tbdrill-<pid>), so it stays correct whether or not a real

# --- the palette owns every colour --------------------------------------------

# hardcoded near-white, correct against the old dark green and 1.88:1 against the
# new one. An invisible checkmark, in one state, discoverable only by hitting
# that state at runtime.

# literal pasted into a view is by definition not one. This is the check that
# sees it, and it costs nothing.
