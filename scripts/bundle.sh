# silently ships with no AppIcon.icns. And it has to be BEFORE signing, because
# the outer signature seals everything inside Contents/, so a framework copied
# in afterwards invalidates it.
#
# Found the expensive way on 2 Sep: embedding sat next to the signing block, the
# icon step warned "could not draw the iconset" into a wall of build output, and
# the first hosted release got all the way through notarizing the app AND the
