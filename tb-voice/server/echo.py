"""Feed the transcriber silence while any voice is playing.

The aggregator's mute drops transcriptions only while it is muted, but a
streaming STT finalises late: at 17:26:42 Gradium delivered fifteen seconds of
the manager's own speech ("Listening. 11 waiting on you… I manage voice loops
for") six seconds after the bot went quiet, past the 0.6 s tail, and it was
judged as the developer asking to send a message. So the echo is removed
before the STT ever hears it: while the bot speaks, for a beat after, and while
the app speaks in a session's voice, the mic frames go through as zeros. Zeros
rather than nothing, so the STT's own endpointing sees continuous audio and
closes the turn cleanly.
