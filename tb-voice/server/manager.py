"""The manager: silence by default, one Jev call per turn, one agent on stage.

Every finished user turn arrives as an LLMContextFrame (the aggregator has already
appended the words to the context). One request to Jev answers two questions at once:
was the manager addressed, and which intent. Most intents are handled here without the
LLM: inviting a session to speak, reading a rung, saying nothing. The LLM runs only for
custom questions, summaries, sends and starts, with the stage handed to it as a note.
