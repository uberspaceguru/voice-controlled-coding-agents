"""Mute the mic while the bot speaks, and for a beat after.

Local audio has no echo cancellation: the manager's own voice through the
speakers came back in as "the user started speaking", interrupted it, and
cancelled the handler mid-flight (16:49:39 and 16:49:59). While the bot is
talking the user's frames are dropped; the tail covers room reverb. A person who
really wants to cut in says "stop" once the line ends, or taps a chord.
