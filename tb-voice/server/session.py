"""Everything the manager remembers, per session and never per process.

Pipecat Cloud returns an instance to the pool when a session ends and hands it
the next one, and nothing in its docs says module state is reset between them.
It is not: on 22 Sep, 4 of 7 hosted sessions on one Mac opened with a previous
session's turns in the exchange Jev and the brain read, because EXCHANGE,
BOT_VOICE and EXTERNAL_UNTIL were module globals. The turns were a drill's,
started against the production agent; with a second account they would have
been another person's. So the state lives on a Session, bound per session the
way wire.Wire is, and every task the pipeline starts inherits it.
